# 👋 Hello there, I'm Swarna

📊I turn "meh" spreadsheets into "wow" dashboards. 
🎓 MBA in Marketing & Analytics | 🧪 BSc in Botany (yes, I like both plants and plots)  
💼 Data & BI Enthusiast | 🌱 Freelance-ready | ☕ Dashboard-fueled

## 🧠 What I Do (And Love)

- Design **insightful, clean Power BI dashboards** for business intelligence
- Explore data like a detective — segment, analyze, visualize
- Blend **marketing logic + analytics skills** for practical impact
- Build stories from spreadsheets using **DAX, Excel, and basic SQL**
- Turn client confusion into “Ohhh, now I see!”

## 🚀 Currently
- Working full-time in the industry 🧑‍💼  
- Freelancing in off-hours — evenings, weekends, and on strong coffee  
- Building my portfolio one dashboard at a time  
- Learning new tools to stay ahead (AI, storytelling, and more)

  ## 🗂️ Portfolio Highlights

### 🔹 [Customer Segmentation Dashboard](https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation)
> 📍 Who buys, why they buy, and who brings in the real profits.  
> Power BI dashboard that uses maps, KPIs, and key influencers to show customer value segments.

### 🔹 [Employee Performance Dashboard](https://github.com/yourusername/employee-performance)
> 👥 Which teams are thriving, who's on fire (the good kind), and where effort meets output.  
> Great for HR and operations tracking.

*(More dashboards in progress. My “Downloads” folder is packed.)*

- **Excel** – Old but gold  
- **DAX** – Like solving puzzles
